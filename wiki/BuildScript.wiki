#summary Example "do-configure" CMake driver script for building Trilinos

= Introduction =

Trilinos uses the CMake build system.  If you are familiar with the GNU Autotools, running CMake is a little bit like running the "configure" script.  After that come the familiar "make" and "make install" steps.  It's typical to invoke CMake indirectly by writing a "do-configure" script, which is a short executable shell script that invokes CMake with the desired build options.  The shell script below is an example of a "do-configure" script.  You should make it executable in your shell environment, and then invoke it, for example:
{{{
$ ./do-configure
}}}

= Sample "do-configure" script =

{{{
#!/bin/sh

#
# You can invoke this shell script with additional command-line
# arguments.  They will be passed directly to CMake.

EXTRA_ARGS=$@

#
# Each invocation of CMake caches the values of build options in a
# CMakeCache.txt file.  If you run CMake again without deleting the
# CMakeCache.txt file, CMake won't notice any build options that have
# changed, because it found their original values in the cache file.
# Deleting the CMakeCache.txt file before invoking CMake will insure
# that CMake learns about any build options you may have changed.
#
rm -f CMakeCache.txt

#
# A sampling of CMake build options.
#
# CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: Where to install Trilinos.
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: DEBUG or RELEASE.
# CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER: The C++ compiler to use when building Trilinos.
# CMAKE_C_COMPILER: The C compiler to use when building Trilinos.
#   Some parts of Trilinos are implemented in C.
# CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER: The Fortran compiler to use when building
#   Trilinos.  Some parts of Trilinos are implemented in Fortran.
# HAVE_GCC_ABI_DEMANGLE: Setting this option to ON improves 
#   debugging messages.
# CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE: Set to OFF (or FALSE) if you prefer a quiet
#   build.
# Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES: If you like, you can build _all_ of
#   Trilinos, but you don't have to.
# Trilinos_ENABLE_Epetra: If ON, build Epetra.
# Trilinos_ENABLE_Triutils: If ON, bulid Triutils.
# Trilinos_ENABLE_TESTS: If ON, build the tests for all packages that
#   are to be built.
# Trilinos_ENABLE_EXAMPLES: If ON, build the examples for all
#   packages that are to be built.
