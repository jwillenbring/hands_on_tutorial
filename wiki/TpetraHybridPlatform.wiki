#summary Tpetra::HybridPlatform for supporting diverse compute nodes

= Introduction =

Tpetra's support for multicore computing proceeds from the Kokkos shared-memory node API. This is a compile-time polymorphic interface, based on template metaprogamming. As such, each Tpetra computational object is templated on a Kokkos node.
