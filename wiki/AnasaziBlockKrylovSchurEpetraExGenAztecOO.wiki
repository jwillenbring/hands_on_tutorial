#summary Use Anasazi's Block Krylov-Schur to solve a generalized eigenvalue problem, with Epetra and AztecOO.

= Introduction =

This example computes the eigenvalues of smallest magnitude of the
discretized 2D Laplacian operator using the block Krylov-Schur method.
This problem shows the construction of an inner-outer iteration using
AztecOO as the linear solver within Anasazi.  An IFPACK preconditioner
is constructed to precondition the linear solver.  This operator is
discretized using linear finite elements and constructed as an Epetra
matrix, then passed into the AztecOO solver to perform the
shift-invert operation to be used within the Krylov decomposition.
The specifics of the block Krylov-Schur method can be set by the user.

Users typically access Anasazi's solvers through subclasses of
[http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/docs/dev/packages/anasazi/doc/html/classAnasazi_1_1SolverManager.html SolverManager].  In this case, [http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/docs/dev/packages/anasazi/doc/html/classAnasazi_1_1BlockKrylovSchurSolMgr.html BlockKrylovSchurSolMgr] presents an
interface to the block Krylov-Schur algorithm.
